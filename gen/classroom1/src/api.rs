This error will also be returned if read-only fields are set, or if the `state` field is set to to a value other than `PENDING`. * `NOT_FOUND` if the student ID provided is a valid student ID, but Classroom has no record of that student. * `ALREADY_EXISTS` if there is already a pending guardian invitation for the student and `invited_email_address` provided, or if the provided `invited_email_address` matches the Google account of an existing `Guardian` for this user.
